# About This Blog

Welcome! I'm glad you're here. This blog is my personal research notebook where I document interesting findings and ideas about investing and trading strategies that I discover through ongoing research—both using AI tools like Perplexity and through manual exploration across the web.

## Who I Am

I'm a finance enthusiast passionate about discovering, understanding, and testing investment strategies. Rather than relying solely on conventional wisdom, I enjoy diving deep into various approaches—from value investing principles to quantitative methods—to see what works and why.

## Why I Created This Blog

The investment and trading landscape is vast and constantly evolving. Through my research, I come across fascinating approaches, strategies, and ideas that deserve deeper exploration and documentation. This blog serves as:

- **A learning journal** - Documenting my research journey and what I discover
- **A knowledge base** - Organizing interesting findings for future reference
- **A sharing platform** - Making these discoveries accessible to others interested in investing and trading

## What You'll Find Here

My posts cover topics including:

- **Investment Strategies** - Value investing, growth investing, momentum, and hybrid approaches
- **Trading Techniques** - Technical analysis, algorithmic concepts, options strategies
- **Portfolio Management** - Asset allocation, diversification, rebalancing methods
- **Quantitative Finance** - Backtesting approaches, statistical analysis, factor investing
- **Research Tools** - Open-source investment tools, data sources, automation workflows
- **Market Insights** - Behavioral finance, market patterns, emerging opportunities

## My Research Approach

I use a combination of methods to discover and analyze investment approaches:

### AI-Assisted Research
I leverage tools like **Perplexity AI** to:
- Synthesize research from multiple sources
- Find connections between different investment philosophies
- Discover emerging trends in quantitative finance
- Understand complex strategies more quickly

### Manual Exploration
I also spend time:
- Reading academic papers and books
- Analyzing case studies of successful investors
- Exploring open-source financial tools and libraries
- Following discussions in investment communities

### Critical Analysis
Every strategy I document here goes through my filter of:
- Does the logic make sense?
- What are the underlying assumptions?
- What are the risks and limitations?
- How could this be tested or validated?

## What This Blog Is NOT

It's important to be clear about what this blog isn't:

- **Not financial advice** - Everything here is for educational and research purposes only
- **Not a news site** - I'm not reporting on daily market movements or breaking news
- **Not a recommendation service** - I don't tell anyone what to buy or sell
- **Not a commercial operation** - No courses, newsletters, or paid services

## A Note on Research vs. Advice

Everything shared here is based on research and exploration—documenting what I find interesting and worth investigating further. I'm not a licensed financial advisor, and nothing on this blog should be considered personalized investment advice.

Always do your own research, understand your own risk tolerance, and consult with qualified professionals before making any investment decisions.

## Connect With Me

I'd love to connect with fellow investors and researchers interested in trading strategies and quantitative finance.

## Continuous Learning

I'm constantly learning and evolving my understanding of markets and investing. The strategies and ideas I write about may change as I discover new information or gain new insights. That's part of the journey, and I try to be transparent about that process.
