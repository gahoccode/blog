## The Last Puff

In the world of investing, few metaphors are as vivid—or as humbling—as Warren Buffett’s “last puff of a cigar.” Early in his career, inspired by Benjamin Graham’s value investing principles, Buffett sought out battered, overlooked companies trading at rock-bottom prices. These businesses were like discarded cigar butts on the street: unattractive, often struggling, but still offering one last “free puff” of profit for the opportunistic investor.

This strategy worked for a time, allowing Buffett to squeeze gains from companies on the brink. But over the years, he came to see its limits. Cheap stocks with weak fundamentals rarely transformed into long-term winners. The profits were fleeting, the problems never-ending, and the compounding power that drives real wealth creation was missing.

Buffett’s evolution away from “cigar-butt investing” toward buying high-quality businesses at fair prices marks a pivotal shift in his investing philosophy—and offers a timeless lesson for investors today.

Warren Buffett’s **“last puff of a cigar”** (or “cigar‑butt”) analogy comes from his early days as a value investor inspired by Benjamin Graham. He described it as a vivid metaphor for **buying very cheap, struggling companies that still have a small profit left to extract before they die out**.

> “If you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price, there will usually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives you a chance to unload at a decent profit, even though the long-term performance may be terrible. I call this the ‘cigar‑butt’ approach to investing… that one puff will make the purchase all profit.”[5][7]

### Why he abandoned the strategy
Later, Buffett admitted this approach was **a mistake for long-term investors**. He said that while one can make short-term gains with “one puff” companies, **their poor fundamentals and recurring problems destroy compounding potential**:

> “Unless you are a liquidator, that kind of approach to buying businesses is foolish… no sooner is one problem solved than another surfaces—never is there just one cockroach in the kitchen.”[7]

In a 2001 speech, he even called the approach **“disgusting,”** likening it to picking up soggy cigarette butts off the street for a free puff before tossing them away.[6]

### What he learned
Buffett eventually moved away from this “cheap stock” mindset after partnering with Charlie Munger, who persuaded him to focus instead on **buying wonderful businesses at fair prices** rather than mediocre ones at bargain prices. As Buffett later summarized:

> “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”[9][7]

In essence, the “last puff” analogy captures Buffett’s early lesson that **cheapness alone isn’t a durable edge**—real wealth comes from owning high-quality businesses that compound value over time.

The “cigar‑butt” investing approach can still be used effectively under certain market conditions, particularly when dealing with **small sums of money** and **deeply undervalued stocks**. The idea is to buy **companies trading below their liquidation or net‑asset value**, wait for a small rebound, and then sell for a quick profit before the business’s long‑term decline resumes.[1][2][3]

### How to apply this approach
1. **Screen for net‑net or liquidation‑value stocks**  
   Look for companies trading for **less than their Net Current Asset Value (NCAV)**—a key metric pioneered by Benjamin Graham. These are usually distressed or ignored securities whose **market cap is lower than current assets minus all liabilities**.[4][3]

2. **Prioritize statistical diversification or focus strategy**  
   - **Walter Schloss‑style:** Hold a broad portfolio (dozens of positions) of cheap net‑net stocks to average out risks. Schloss generated **about 15% annual returns** over 45 years using this diversified approach.[4]
   - **Buffett‑style:** Focus on a concentrated set of deeply undervalued small firms and hold until a revaluation occurs. In the 1950s, Buffett achieved **above 30% annualized returns** managing small sums this way.[3][4]

3. **Exploit temporary catalysts**  
   Profits often come from **short‑term events** such as asset sales, liquidation prospects, restructuring, or sentiment reversals. The goal is to capture the “last puff” of value rather than wait for business revival.[2]

4. **Sell quickly once fair value is reached**  
   The approach depends on **turning over capital rapidly**—selling as soon as the price rises near intrinsic or liquidation value. Holding too long erodes returns since weak businesses often continue to deteriorate.[2]

### When it works best
- In **bear markets or neglected sectors** where small‑cap or illiquid stocks are deeply discounted.  
- For **small investors or micro‑funds** who can profit from inefficiencies institutional investors ignore.  
- When applying **strict discipline** on valuation, diversification, and selling rules.[3][4][2]

### Risks and limitations
Buffett himself later warned that this method is “foolish unless you are a liquidator,” because deteriorating businesses keep generating new problems, and time works against mediocre companies.[5][2]
For most investors, it’s a **short‑term, opportunistic tactic**—not a sustainable wealth‑building approach.

Screening for “cigar‑butt” stocks means systematically identifying companies trading below their **net current asset value (NCAV)** or **liquidation value**, following Benjamin Graham’s criteria that inspired Buffett’s early strategy. Below are clear, practical steps for finding these deep‑value opportunities.

***

### Step 1: Gather financial data
Use stock screeners such as **screener.in**, **GrahamValue**, or **NetNetHunter** that allow filtering by **balance‑sheet metrics**. You’ll need data for current assets, total liabilities, and market capitalization.[1][2]

***

### Step 2: Calculate Net Current Asset Value (NCAV)
Use Graham’s formula:

$$
NCAV = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}
$$

Then find the **NCAV per share (NCAVPS)**:

$$
NCAVPS = \frac{NCAV}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

If a company is trading at **less than 2/3 of its NCAVPS**, it qualifies as a potential cigar‑butt candidate.[3][4][5]

***

### Step 3: Apply screening criteria
Filter for stocks that meet these conditions:

| Screening Criterion | Explanation | Typical Threshold |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Market cap < NCAV** | Firm is valued below its liquid assets minus debt | True “net‑net” condition [1] |
| **Price ≤ 2/3 × NCAVPS** | Margin of safety for undervaluation | < 66% of NCAVPS [3][5] |
| **Low debt ratio** | Prevent insolvency risk | Debt/Equity < 0.5 [5] |
| **Positive or small profit/loss** | Company still operating, not bankrupt | Slightly positive net income [1] |
| **Small/micro‑cap focus** | Inefficiently priced segment | Market cap under $200M typical [6] |

Screeners like **screener.in** use presets combining these filters—e.g., “Market cap < NCAV, current assets > total liabilities, P/E < 15,” etc..[1]

***

### Step 4: Qualitative checks
Quantitative undervaluation isn’t enough—verify that:

- Management isn’t **diluting shares** or **burning cash aggressively**  
- Core assets (cash, receivables, inventory) are **realizable**  
- No major **litigation, regulatory**, or **fraud risk** exists   
- The company isn’t dependent on a dying product or geography.[7][8]

***

### Step 5: Buy with a clear exit plan
Once purchased:

- **Sell** when price returns near **NCAV or intrinsic value** (usually 30–50% gain target).  
- Avoid long holds—these are not compounding businesses.  
- Maintain **broad diversification** (15–30 names) to offset inevitable losers.[9][6]

***

### Step 6: Monitor catalysts
Look for short‑term triggers like **asset sales, delistings, or restructurings**, which often unlock value quickly. The typical holding period is **6–24 months**.[8]

***

### Example calculation
Suppose:
- Current assets = \$100M
- Total liabilities = \$70M
- Shares outstanding = 10M
→ NCAVPS = \((100 - 70)/10 = \$3\).
If the stock trades at \$1.80, it's at **60% of NCAVPS**, qualifying under Graham's rule.

***

This disciplined screening process works best for **patient, small investors** who can tolerate illiquidity and conduct deep due diligence before buying.
