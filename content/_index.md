# Welcome to My Investment Research Notebook

This is where I document interesting findings and ideas about investing and trading strategies that I discover through ongoing researchâ€”using both AI tools like Perplexity and manual exploration across the web.

## What You'll Find Here

I explore and share research on:

- **Investment Strategies** - Value investing, growth approaches, momentum trading, and hybrid methods
- **Quantitative Finance** - Backtesting techniques, statistical analysis, factor investing
- **Portfolio Management** - Asset allocation strategies, diversification, rebalancing methods
- **Trading Psychology** - Behavioral finance insights, market inefficiencies, decision-making
- **Research Tools** - Open-source platforms, data sources, automation workflows

## My Research Approach

Every post here represents strategies and ideas I've found compelling enough to document. I use:

- **AI-assisted discovery** through Perplexity AI to synthesize research from multiple sources
- **Manual research** diving into academic papers, books, and investment case studies
- **Critical analysis** examining assumptions, risks, and practical applications

## Not Financial Advice

This blog is a personal research journal documenting my learning journey. Nothing here should be considered personalized investment advice. Always conduct your own research and consult qualified professionals before making investment decisions.
