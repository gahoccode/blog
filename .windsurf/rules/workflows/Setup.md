# Installation

## 1. Install the Theme via Hugo Modules

Run the following command:

```bash
hugo mod get github.com/jpanther/congo/v2

2. Create config/_default/module.toml

Add the following content:

[[imports]]
path = "github.com/jpanther/congo/v2"

⚠️ Important: Do not overwrite this file later!

3. Start the Hugo Server

Use the command:

hugo server

The theme will be downloaded automatically.

4. Replace Default Config Files

In your website’s root folder:
	1.	Delete the hugo.toml file generated by Hugo.
	2.	Copy the *.toml config files from the theme into your config/_default/ folder.

✅ This sets up your theme properly while preserving the module configuration.

Let me know if you want this as a `README.md` or part of a full setup guide.
